# Mesh Splitter for 3DS Max

These are a series of scripts used to split meshes in various different ways. Useful for processing meshes ready for importing to other packages, or simply splitting them up into individual parts.

- **Split To Elements**: This splits all sub-elements in the users selection to unique meshes.
- **Split by Face Colour**: This script splits all selected meshes depending on the colours of the faces.
- **Split By Smoothing Group**: Splits all selected meshes into unique meshes from the smoothing groups of all faces.
- **Split By Material ID**: Splits the meshes into unique meshes from the given face material IDs.


## Installing:

Unzip the file to any desired location on your hard drive
In the 3DS Max menus, go to `Scripting -> Run Script` and find the `install.py` script (in the root folder for the tool).
Running the Scripts (GUI):

To run the scripts in GUI mode, in 3DS max go to `Scripting -> Run Script` and find the `mesh_splitter_gui.ms` script (in the root folder for the tool).
This will launch a separate tool with interfaces for all 4 scripts. Just click the one you want and that's it!


## Assigning Hotkeys:

Macros are generated for quick running of all available scripts, including the GUI.
